            <h3>I am passionate about learning how
            things work, which is why I’ve, chose
            Veterinary Medicine. Also I’m an animal
            lover and an emphatic person.
            Beyond that, I’m curious, self-learning
            and I have a critical mind. I’ve decided to
            learn front-end development because I
            wanted to develop my IT skills gained in
            the high school period. I think front end
            development it’s the perfect way to
            combine my skills with my creative mind.
